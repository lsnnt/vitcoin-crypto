Basically,We are working on Block chain, we want to make VIT coins on our test server node we have created. In that, we will get both ETH and vit coins that can be used by the user for transactions. Eth coins can't be directly used by the users because when it operates, it demands some transaction fees, so the actual ETH is not transferred to the user. So VIT coins should be used for the main transactions, and ETH coins should cover transaction fees and all the transaction details and amount will be stored in the transaction I'd which can be accessed on the block explorer.

The steps include are, In AWS, we purchased an instance server. Then we installed NVM, Node.js, and NPM in our software, Then we installed Ganache Cly in our server. Then on port 80, we hosted our RPC URL test network. Then on cloud flare, we pointed the subdomain of our domain to that instance IP address. Sub domain = testnode.nnnt.shop Chain I'd = 1337 for test node. Then we created Block Explorer to check the status of transactions and details of transactions for the user and the user receiving the coins.
